# SpaceGame (Babylon Edition)

Just load index.html into Chrome (or any browser that supports WebGL) and play!

Note that this will not work on a computer that does not have hardware graphics acceleration.

## Controls

Controls:

- `w` to thrust forward.
- `s` to reverse thrust.
- `a` to rotate left.
- `d` to rotate right.
- `c` to re-center the camera.
- `shift` to decelerate (not the same as reversing thrust).
- `space` to fire straight ahead

You can move around the camera a little by holding the left mouse button and dragging around.

## About

This uses the [Babylon.js](http://www.babylonjs.com/) game engine thing.
